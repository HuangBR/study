  * Void Elements

    The void elements are ones that do not have a closing tag and 
    therefore cannot have content placed inside them, and they make no nest. The void elements are: 

      __area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, keygen, link, meta, param, source, track, wbr__

      * What is SVG?
        ```
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
        SVG defines the graphics in XML format
        SVG graphics do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized
         Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated
        SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL
