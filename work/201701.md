        extended asm statements must be inside a function, Only basic asm may be outside functions
        The asm keyword is a GNU extension. When writing code that can be compiled with ‘-ansi’ and the various ‘-std’ options, use __asm__ instead of asm

        Simple Constraints:
        * ‘g’ Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for registers that are not general registers.
        * ‘r’ A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general register.
            a	%eax
            b 	%ebx
            c 	%ecx
            d 	%edx
            S	%esi
            D	%edi
        * ‘m’ A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine supports in general.
        * ‘o’ A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is offsettable. 
        * 'p' An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed. This is for “load address”
              and “push address” instructions.

        Constraint Modifier Characters:
            When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints, it needs to
            know which operands are read by the instruction and which are written by it.
            1.‘=’ identifies an operand which is only written; 
            2. ‘+’ identifies an operand that is both read and written; 
            3. all other operands are assumed to only be read.
        * '=' Means that this operand is written to by this instruction: the previous value is discarded and replaced by new data.
        * '+' Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.
        * '&' Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an earlyclobber operand, which is written before the instruction 
            is finished using the input operands.Therefore, this operand may not lie in a register that is read by the instruction or 
            as part of any memory address.
        * '%' Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the following operand. This means that the compiler
            may interchange the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the constraints. ‘%’ applies to
            all alternatives and must appear as the first character in the constraint. Only read-only operands can use ‘%’.

    * exceptions and interrupts 
      The difference between interrupts and exceptions is that interrupts are used to
      handle asynchronous events external to the processor, but exceptions handle
      conditions detected by the processor itself in the course of executing
      instructions.
      1. interrupts
        * Maskable interrupts, which are signalled via the INTR pin.
        * Nonmaskable interrupts, which are signalled via the NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) pin.
      2. exceptions
        * Processor detected. These are further classified as 
          1. faults: Faults are either detected before the instruction begins to execute, or during execution of the instruction.
                      If detected during the instruction, the fault is reported with the machine restored to a state that permits the
                      instruction to be restarted.
          2. traps: A trap is an exception that is reported at the instruction boundary immediately after the instruction 
                    in which the exception was detected. 
          3. aborts: An abort is an exception that permits neither precise location of the instruction causing the exception nor restart of the program
                      that caused the exception. Aborts are used to report severe errors, such as hardware errors and inconsistent or 
                      illegal values in system tables.
        * Programmed. The instructions INTO, INT 3, INT n, and BOUND can trigger exceptions.
          These instructions are often called "software interrupts", but the processor handles them as exceptions.

  This tutorial was created in an attempt to show you, the reader, how to set up the basics for a kernel. This involves:
    1) Setting up your development environment
    2) The basics: Setting the stage for GRUB
    3) Linking in other files and calling main()
    4) Printing to the screen
    5) Setting up a custom Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
    6) Setting up a custom Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
    7) Setting up Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) to handle your Interrupts and IRQs
    8) Remapping the Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs) to new IDT entries
    9) Installing and servicing IRQs
    10) Managing the Programmable Interval Timer / System Clock (PIT)
    11) Managing Keyboard IRQs and Keyboard Data
    12) ...and the rest is up to you!
  * idt
    The IDT may contain any of three kinds of gate descriptors:
    • Task-gate descriptor
    • Interrupt-gate descriptor
    • Trap-gate descriptor
    range: 0 - 255. 0 - 31 are reserved by the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures for architecture-defined exceptions and interrupts.

  * idt implements
    * code, data, and stack segments that make up the execution environment of a program or procedure
    * two system segments: the task-state segment (TSS) and the LDT. 
    * The GDT is not considered a segment because it is not accessed by means of a segment selector and segment descriptor.
    * TSSs and LDTs have segment descriptors defined for them.
    * a set of special descriptors called gates (call gates, interrupt gates, trap gates, and task gates)

    * In switching tasks, the processor performs the following actions:
      1. Stores the state of the current task in the current TSS.
      2. Loads the task register with the segment selector for the new task.
      3. Accesses the new TSS through a segment descriptor in the GDT.
      4. Loads the state of the new task from the new TSS into the general-purpose registers, the segment registers,
         the LDTR, control register CR3 (base address of the paging-structure hierarchy), the EFLAGS register, and the
         EIP register.
    
  * Interrupt and Exception Handling
    * IDT
      * External interrupts, software interrupts and exceptions are handled through the interrupt descriptor table (IDT).
      * The IDT stores a collection of gate descriptors that provide access to interrupt and exception handlers. 
        * gate descriptors contains:
          1. interrupt gate : the associated handler procedure is accessed in a manner similar to calling a procedure through a call gate  
          2. trap gate : the associated handler procedure is accessed in a manner similar to calling a procedure through a call gate   
          3. task gate: the handler is accessed through a task switch.
      * IDT is not a segment, like GDT, base adress of idt is in IDTR
      *  interrupt vector provides an index into the IDT coming from:
        1. internal hardware
        2. an external interrupt controller
        3. software by means of an INT, INTO, INT 3, or BOUND instruction

  * memory management

    * physical addressing 
      a linear address is treated as a physical address.

    * paging (virtual memory)
      all code, data, stack, and system segments (including the GDT and IDT) can be paged with only 
      the most recently accessed pages(page frames) being held in physical memory.
      * locate in physical memory containing in page structures
      * base address of the paging-structure in CR3
      * page structure contains:
        1. the base of a page frame
        2. access rights
        3. memory management Information

    * logical and linear address 
      logical -> linear:
      * segment selector -> gdt -> segment descriptor
      * examine access rights and range of segments
      * base address + offset -> linear addres
    
    * paging (linear-address translation)
      linear -> physical


  * System Registers
    * The system flags and IOPL field in the EFLAGS register control task and mode switching, interrupt handling,
      instruction tracing, and access rights.
    * The control registers (CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4) contain a variety of flags and data fields for controlling 
      systemlevel operations. Other flags in these registers are used to indicate support for specific processor 
      capabilities within the operating system or executive.
    * The debug registers  allow the setting of breakpoints for use in debugging programs and systems software. 
    * The GDTR, LDTR, and IDTR registers contain the linear addresses and sizes (limits) of their respective tables.
    * The task register contains the linear address and size of the TSS for the current task. 
    * Model-specific registers
      The model-specific registers (MSRs) are a group of registers available primarily to operating-system or executive
      procedures (that is, code running at privilege level 0). These registers control items such as the debug extensions,
      the performance-monitoring counters, the machine- check architecture, and the memory type ranges (MTRRs).
  
  * mode of operations
                PE = 1 | 0                    VM = 1 | 0
    real mode  <-----------> protected mode <---------------> Virtual-8086 mode 
    
    virtual-8086: allows the processor execute 8086 software in a protected, multitasking environment.

        * [registers for pic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_Interrupt_Controller)
          * Interrupt Request Register (IRR):
            specifies which interrupts are pending acknowledgement,
            and is typically a symbolic register which can not be directly accessed
          * In-Service Register (ISR):
            The ISR register specifies which interrupts have been acknowledged,
            but are still waiting for an End Of Interrupt (EOI).
          * Interrupt Mask Register (IMR):
            specifies which interrupts are to be ignored and not acknowledged. 
          
          A simple register schema such as this allows up to two distinct interrupt requests to be outstanding 
          at one time, one waiting for acknowledgement, and one waiting for EOI.

          There are a number of common priority schemas in PICs including hard priorities, specific priorities, and 
          rotating priorities.

          Interrupts may be either edge triggered or level triggered.

          There are a number of common ways of acknowledging an interrupt has completed when an EOI is issued. 
          These include specifying which interrupt completed, using an implied interrupt which has 
          completed (usually the highest priority pending in the ISR), and treating interrupt acknowledgement as the EOI.
                                   
                    not masked                Priority Resolver simply selects the IRQ of highest priority.

            myprintf(fmt, ...)
          2. use of alloca
          3. use of computed goto
          4. use of nonlocal goto
          5. use of nested functions
          6. use of setjmp
          7. use of __builtin_longjmp, __builtin_return or __builtin_apply_args
        * no inline when no optimizing unless use 'always-inline':
          ```c
          /* Prototype. */
          inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));   
          ```
        * a non-static inline function is always compiled on its own in the usual fashion for that:
          * the compiler must assume that there may be calls from other source fles
          * a global symbol can be defned only once in any program, the function must not be 
            defned in the other source files,so the calls therein cannot be integrated.
        * inline and extern in the function defnition,then the defnition is used only for inlining
          * function never compiled to its own, not even if you refer to its address explicitly.Such an address 
            becomes an external reference, as if you had only declared the function, and had not defned it.
          * This combination of inline and extern has almost the eﬀect of a macro. 
            * function definition in a header file with inline and extern keywords,
              causes most calls to the function to be inlined
            * put another copy of definition (lack inline and extern) in a library file, 
              any uses of the function refer to single copy in library
