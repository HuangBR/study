        extended asm statements must be inside a function, Only basic asm may be outside functions
        The asm keyword is a GNU extension. When writing code that can be compiled with ‘-ansi’ and the various ‘-std’ options, use __asm__ instead of asm

        Simple Constraints:
        * ‘g’ Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for registers that are not general registers.
        * ‘r’ A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general register.
            a	%eax
            b 	%ebx
            c 	%ecx
            d 	%edx
            S	%esi
            D	%edi
        * ‘m’ A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine supports in general.
        * ‘o’ A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is offsettable. 

        Constraint Modifier Characters:
            When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints, it needs to
            know which operands are read by the instruction and which are written by it.
            1.‘=’ identifies an operand which is only written; 
            2. ‘+’ identifies an operand that is both read and written; 
            3. all other operands are assumed to only be read.
        * '=' Means that this operand is written to by this instruction: the previous value is discarded and replaced by new data.
        * '+' Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.
        * '&' Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an earlyclobber operand, which is written before the instruction 
            is finished using the input operands.Therefore, this operand may not lie in a register that is read by the instruction or 
            as part of any memory address.
        * '%' Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the following operand. This means that the compiler
            may interchange the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the constraints. ‘%’ applies to
            all alternatives and must appear as the first character in the constraint. Only read-only operands can use ‘%’.

    * exceptions and interrupts 
      The difference between interrupts and exceptions is that interrupts are used to
      handle asynchronous events external to the processor, but exceptions handle
      conditions detected by the processor itself in the course of executing
      instructions.
      1. interrupts
        * Maskable interrupts, which are signalled via the INTR pin.
        * Nonmaskable interrupts, which are signalled via the NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) pin.
      2. exceptions
        * Processor detected. These are further classified as 
          1. faults: Faults are either detected before the instruction begins to execute, or during execution of the instruction.
                      If detected during the instruction, the fault is reported with the machine restored to a state that permits the
                      instruction to be restarted.
          2. traps: A trap is an exception that is reported at the instruction boundary immediately after the instruction 
                    in which the exception was detected. 
          3. aborts: An abort is an exception that permits neither precise location of the instruction causing the exception nor restart of the program
                      that caused the exception. Aborts are used to report severe errors, such as hardware errors and inconsistent or 
                      illegal values in system tables.
        * Programmed. The instructions INTO, INT 3, INT n, and BOUND can trigger exceptions.
          These instructions are often called "software interrupts", but the processor handles them as exceptions.

      In real mode offsets are limited to 64K, because of the 16-bit nature of the 8086. 
      In real mode, the segment address is shifted left four bits and added to the offset, allowing for a 20 bit address (20 bits = 1 MB); 
      in protected mode segments are offsets into a table in memory which tells where the segment is located.

  This tutorial was created in an attempt to show you, the reader, how to set up the basics for a kernel. This involves:
    1) Setting up your development environment
    2) The basics: Setting the stage for GRUB
    3) Linking in other files and calling main()
    4) Printing to the screen
    5) Setting up a custom Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
    6) Setting up a custom Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
    7) Setting up Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) to handle your Interrupts and IRQs
    8) Remapping the Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs) to new IDT entries
    9) Installing and servicing IRQs
    10) Managing the Programmable Interval Timer / System Clock (PIT)
    11) Managing Keyboard IRQs and Keyboard Data
    12) ...and the rest is up to you!
  * idt
    The IDT may contain any of three kinds of gate descriptors:
    • Task-gate descriptor
    • Interrupt-gate descriptor
    • Trap-gate descriptor
    range: 0 - 255. 0 - 31 are reserved by the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures for architecture-defined exceptions and interrupts.

    * ISR(Interrupt Service Routine) is the code executed when an interrupt occurs.
      CPU takes care of the most compilcated part by saving the SS, EIP, ESP, and CS registers to the stack.
